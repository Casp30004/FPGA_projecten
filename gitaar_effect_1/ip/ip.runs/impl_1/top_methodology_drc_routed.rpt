TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_out1_clk_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_clk_wiz_0_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin clocking_wizard_1/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive.
